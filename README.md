# ThreatParser
Warrior tank threat parser for classic wow

To start, either run ThreatParser.exe or run ThreatParser.py with python (some standard packages required).  
Enter your Warcraftlogs report ID, press Fetch.  
Select the options and the tank and boss to parse.  
Voil√°.  

**Notes:** 
Only threat on the actual boss counts, ie not on adds.
Only top ranks of abilities are registered.

TODO:
 - Trim python packages
 - Fix window sizing
 - More optimized GET from warcraftlogs
 - Filter non warrior tanks from player list
 - Manual selection input, button for snug fit
 - Graph granularity option(s)
 - Dragging selection out of data should update table
 - Clear output when a new fetch is done
