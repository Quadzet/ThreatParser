**Note:** Only threat on the actual boss counts, ie not on adds.

TODO:
 - More optimized GET from warcraftlogs
 - Filter non warrior tanks from player list
 - Rage gains, Gift of Arthas, battle shout
 - Manual selection input, button for snug fit
 - Graph granularity option(s)
 - Dragging selection out of data should update table
 - Clear output when a new fetch is done
 - Fix table sorting
